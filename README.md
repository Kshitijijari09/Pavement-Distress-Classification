# Pavement Distress Classification

This project focuses on pavement distress classification using deep learning techniques. The goal is to classify different types of pavement distress, particularly focusing on binary and multiclass classification tasks. The models utilized in this project include EfficientNetB3 and ResNet18.

## Overview

Pavement distress classification is a critical task in transportation engineering, aiding in the maintenance and management of road infrastructure. By accurately identifying and classifying pavement distress types, such as cracks and potholes, authorities can prioritize repairs and ensure road safety.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images depicting various types of pavement distress, including cracks, potholes, and surface wear. Due to limited availability of labeled data, synthetic image generation techniques were employed to augment the dataset. Specifically, a synthetic image dataset of cracked pavement was generated to enhance model performance and robustness.

## Models

Two deep learning models were employed for pavement distress classification:

1. **EfficientNetB3**: A powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture known for its efficiency and effectiveness in image classification tasks.
2. **ResNet18**: A classic CNN architecture featuring residual connections, capable of learning intricate features in images.

These models were trained and fine-tuned using the augmented dataset to achieve accurate classification results.

## Training and Evaluation

The models were trained using a combination of synthetic and real image data. Training involved optimizing model parameters to minimize classification errors and improve performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The performance of the models was evaluated using appropriate validation techniques, ensuring robustness and generalization to unseen data.

## Results

The classification results demonstrated the efficacy of the trained models in accurately identifying and classifying pavement distress types. The synthetic image dataset significantly enhanced model performance, particularly in scenarios with limited real-world data availability.

## Conclusion

Pavement distress classification using deep learning techniques offers a promising approach to improve road infrastructure maintenance and management. By leveraging synthetic image generation and state-of-the-art CNN architectures, this project demonstrates the potential to achieve accurate and reliable pavement distress classification results.
